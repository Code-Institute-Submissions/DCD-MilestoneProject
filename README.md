# Data Centric Development Milestone Project
<details><summary>Details</summary>
- The aim of this project is to build a data-driven web application that allows users to store and access cooking recipes.
- Users will be able to add, edit and delete recipes.
- Recipes stored will be grouped base on their attributes such as cuisines, country of origin, allergens, ingredients, etc. Such groups will be clickable to reveal recipes that fall into their respective categories.
- On top of basic grouping, users will also be able to search for recipes.
- The application will provide user registeration and authentication for better security. (i.e. users can only edit or delete recipes they created)
